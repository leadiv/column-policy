Column Policy
===========

A SASS mixin for generating flexible grid like layouts from a collection of elements.

## Dependencies

This depends on SASS (version 3.3.7 or greater) and Compass (version 0.12.6 or greater) being installed on the system.

## Quick And Dirty Starting Point

### Download the files
This can be done using `git clone`, downlowning a release zip/tar or using bower (`bower install https://github.com/leadiv/column-policy.git`).

### Include the mixin
Include the mixin where you want to use it. 
Example:
`@import "path/to/sass/files/_column-policy";`

### Modify base functionality (if needed)
Set any global settings using `@include column-policy-options(...);`. This can be done just after `@import` or as a separate file like `_use-column-policy.scss`.

### Generate global CSS
There is a little bit of CSS that is generated on first run. This is generated by the `column-policy-base` mixin.

### Use the mixin!
Where columns are needed use `@include column-policy(...);`

### Ensure the markup can pick up the styles
In the HTML markup ensure that the items that are in a grid have a column class. The default classname is `column`.
